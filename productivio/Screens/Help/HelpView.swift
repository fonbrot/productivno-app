Master your time and boost productivity using the Pomodoro Technique.

**What is the Pomodoro Technique?**

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. It involves breaking your workday into 25-minute focused intervals called "Pomodoros," separated by short breaks. This technique helps improve concentration and reduces mental fatigue.

**How it works:**

1. **Choose a Task**: Select a task you want to accomplish.
2. **Set the Timer**: Start a 25-minute Pomodoro session.
3. **Work Focusedly**: Concentrate on the task without interruptions.
4. **Take a Short Break**: After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break.
5. **Repeat**: After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

**Using App**

- **Start a Pomodoro Session**: Tap the "Start" button to begin a 25-minute timer.
- **Break Notifications**: The app will alert you when it's time to take a break.
- **Customize Timers**: Adjust Pomodoro and break lengths in the settings to suit your preferences.
- **Track Progress**: Monitor your completed Pomodoros and track your productivity stats.

### **Tips for Effective Use**

- **Eliminate Distractions**: Turn off unrelated notifications during Pomodoro sessions.
- **Prioritize Tasks**: Tackle the most important tasks during your peak productivity hours.
- **Stay Consistent**: Make the Pomodoro Technique a regular part of your routine.
- **Adjust as Needed**: Feel free to modify the intervals to find what works best for you.
